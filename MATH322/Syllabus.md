## Class Protocol

### Participation

The lesson format will vary from day to day with students expected to read and write in and outside of class, speak within problem solving groups, and to address the class, and listen to the ideas of others.

### Attendance

Attendance is required and roll will be taken. If you cannot attend class, notify the instructor *prior* to your return to class to make arrangements to be prepared for the next class. *No makeup work will be considered without such prior arrangements. No makeup tests will be given.*
