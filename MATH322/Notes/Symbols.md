# Symbols used in this course

## Sets are denoted by capital letters

$A=\{\emptyset,7,11,Blue,Tom\}$

## Elements of a set are lower case

$a\in A$ means "a is an element of A"

## Subsets

When "A is a subset of B", we write $A\subset B$

## Quantifiers

$\existsâ€‹$

$\forall$

## Cartesian Product

$A\times B = {(a,b)|a\in A\and b\in B}$

## Divides

$a\mid b$ means "a divides b"

## Symmetric Difference (XOR)

$A\oplus B$ is the set of all entities in A or B, but not in both
