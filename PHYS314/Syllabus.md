## General Policies

### How To Use This Syllabus

This syllabus is a course overview and provides you with specific information regarding the course as well as important university policies - it is not a contract. It may change as the semester evolves; if it does a future "version number" will be indicated on Blackboard.

### Course Description

Physics is the fundamental science. One of its goals is a coherent understanding of what we physically observe. To that end, we will study a variety of interesting physical phenomena from the motion of cars, rockets, and trains all the way up to the motion of stars and galaxies and all the way down to the motion of a single electron. Needless to say these are complicated processes, and to study these in any useful manner we have to use an indispensable tool - physical modeling. *This is not a math course.* Analyzing, interpreting what we observe, and translating problems into mathematical equationsis the “physics” of the problem. This is more important (and often times more difficult) than solving the equations mathematically (which is often easier.)

### MLOs

- Reason about electrical systems using fields and conservation laws
- Understand and invoke theparticle and wave model to study physical processes
- Apply the sources and effects of magnetic fields to study electromagnetic phenomena
- Solve mathematical models symbolically and numerically
- Explain conceptually about physical models including when to ignore phenomena
- Interpret information graphically and diagrammatically

### Required Texts

Knight, Randall D. *Physics for Scientists and Engineers, 4th ed.* From Blackboard you will have access to an accompanying course site. This site has many useful resources computer simulations of concepts, and extra video demos/lectures. Available also is the student solutions manual which contains detailed solutions to roughly half of the odd-numbered problems. The Student Workbook is also available for extra practice.

### Physics Help Room

Located in Jabara Hall 029, the physics help room is a great resource for students to get extra help on physics concepts and problems. It is staffed by physics majors, GTA’s, and members of faculty. It will be open a couple weeks into the semester. Check with the physics office for times and schedules.

## Grading

| Section         | Percentage |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Reading Quizzes | 15%        |
| Online Homework | 30%        |
| Quizzes         | 40%        |
| Final Exam      | 15%        |

### Reading Quizzes
You are required to have read the material before it is presented in class, so we will have regular reading quizzes before starting each chapter.  Each RQ will consist of 5 multiple choice questions, and they will be due on the evening of the day we start that chapter. Each question will be worth two points and all will be totaled up for your final grade in this category (RQ’s are not weighted all equally.) Under no circumstances will make-up reading quizzes be given. Since we will cover 15 chapters, each will ultimately be worth 1% of your total grade.

### Online Homework

Online homework will be one of the primary ways your practice physics problems to reinforce your understanding of the concepts. Since physics is a subject that requires constant practice for retention, homework should be worked on every day. Homework will be due every Wednesday evening. 

Our online homework system is MasteringPhysics®. It is built into BlackBoard. Do not try to access it directly from the Mastering Physics website - you must go through Blackboard. The homework will be due at 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday. We will use some class time to discuss homework questions that you have. The due date will not be extended for any reason. Excuses (working late, computer being unable to connect to the Internet, not having access to a computer, etc.) for being unable to complete to homework won’t be considered - everyone has their own schedule to manage. There will be extra credit homework though!

### Quizzes

There will be five in-class quizzes (roughly after every unit.) These are designed to measure classroom understanding of recently introduced concepts and calculations. Phones, tablets, and other smart devices are not allowed on quizzes and the final. You may use only a scientific calculator or graphing calculator - no calculator sharing allowed. I will drop your one lowest quiz. This means that a total of 4 quizzes will count towards your final grade.

#### Make-up Quizzes
If you are unable to attend class on the day of a quiz, you must contact the instructor before the quiz to let him know you can’t be there. Only then will I allow a make-up quiz. They will be administered at the Testing Center (Jabara Hall 371.) You will have until the following Friday to take it. Of course it will be more difficult since you will have had more time to study. Please be aware of the Testing Center’s hours - they’re not the same as the Math Lab itself.

### FInal Exam
For your reference I have included the date and time of this course’s scheduled final exam:

**Wednesday, December 12 | 9:00 - 10:50 am | Jabara Hall 104**

The exam will have two parts. The first will be a department-wide 314 final exam which is timed and will last about 60 minutes and will most likely be curved in some way. The second part will be my own created part and will be cumulative with emphasis on course material with which the class had initial difficulty. The department assessment will count for 5% of your overall grade. The instructor exam will count for 10% of your overall grade. No make-up finals will be given without legal or medical documentation!

### Attendence
I will take attendance everyday for compliance with university and governmental policies. It will not be counted in your final grade calculation.
